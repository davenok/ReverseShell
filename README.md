# ReverseShell

This was a project from a uDemy tutorial.
https://www.udemy.com/course/python-network-programming-tcpip-socket-programming/

This uses Python & Sockets to establish a reverse shell, so that the server app can issue basic command line functions to the client.

Fairly limited but demonstrates sockets.
